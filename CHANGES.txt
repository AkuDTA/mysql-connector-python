Requirements & Dependencies
---------------------------

MySQL Connector/Python v2.0 works with:

- Python v2.6 and v2.7
- Python v3.3 and later

Although earlier versions of MySQL Server might work, we recommend MySQL 5.6
or later. Connector/Python will not work with MySQL 4.0 or earlier.


Download & Installation
-----------------------

MySQL Connector/Python comes packaged for a few platforms. You will find
RPM, Apple OS X, Debian and Windows packages here:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/

We also provide Platform Independent packages as ZIP or TAR archives. These,
when unpacked, can be used to install the connector on any platform on
which a supported version of Python is installed.

To install Connector/Python using the ZIP or TAR archive, using a Terminal:

  shell> tar xzf mysql-connector-python-2.0.0.tar.gz
  shell> cd mysql-connector-python-2.0.0/
  shell> python setup.py install

For Windows, you can use a GUI tool to unarchive the ZIP distribution.

It is also possible to use the Python tool `pip` to install packages through
the Python Package Index (PyPI).

After installing `pip` (comes with Python 3.4):

  shell> pip install mysql-connector-python

Note that newer `pip` versions require an extra option to allow external
packages:

  shell> pip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python \
    mysql-connector-python


Documentation & Examples
------------------------

Documentation for all Connector/Python versions can be found online here:

 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/index.html

The source distribution of Connector/Python also contains example scripts.
They can be found in the examples/ directory.
